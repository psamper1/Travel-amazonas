            Tourists walk along trails on Monkey Island (21 miles from Leticia, 45 minutes by boat), learning about the various monkey species that live there. Normally, they eat insects, but if you have some bananas, the monkeys will come to you for food. Be careful; they will climb all over you. You can also tour flooded areas directly into Lake Tucuchira in traditional canoes, learning how people in these regions survive through traditional fishing.
